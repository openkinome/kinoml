# KinoML

Welcome to the Documentation of KinoML! The documentation is divided into two parts:

* **User guide**: in this section you will learn how to use KinoML to filter and download data from a data base, featurize your kinase data so that it is ML friendly and train and evaluate a ML model on your featurized kinase data. You will also learn about the KinoML object model, and how to access each of these objects. We also provide a detailed examples of how to use every featurizer implemented within KinoML.

* **Experiment tutorials**: this section shows how to use KinoML to  ML structure-based experiments. All experiments are structure-based and they are all end to end, from data collection to model training and evaluation.

    

KinoML falls under the [OpenKinome](https://openkinome.org) initiative, which aims to leverage the increasingly available bioactivity data and scalable computational resources to perform kinase-centric drug design in the context of structure-informed machine learning and free energy calculations. `KinoML` is the main library supporting these efforts.
