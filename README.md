**KinoML** is a modular and extensible framework for machine learning
(ML) in small molecule drug discovery with a special focus on kinases.
It enables users to easily:

1.  **Access and download data**: from online data sources, such as
    ChEMBL or PubChem as well as from their own files, with a focus on
    data availability and inmutability.
2.  **Featurize data**: so that it is ML readeable. KinoML offers a wide
    variety of featurization schemes, from ligand-only to ligand:kinase
    complexes.
3.  **Run structure-based experiments**: using KinoML's implemented
    models, with a special focus on reproducibility.

The purpose of KinoML is to help users conduct ML kinase experiments,
from data collection to model evaluation. Tutorials on how to use KinoML
as well as working examples showcasing how to use KinoML to perform
experiments end-to-end can be found
[here.](https://github.com/raquellrios/kinoml/tree/master/tutorials)
Note that despite KinoML's focus being on kinases, it can be applied to
any protein system. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the
[Documentation](https://openkinome.org/kinoml/index.html).

A KinoML workflow to achieve points **1, 2** and **3** is illustrated in
the following image:

same class.

### Notice

Please be aware that this code is work in progress and is not guaranteed
to provide the expected results. The API can change at any time without
warning.

### Installation

KinoML and its dependencies can be installed via conda/mamba.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/openkinome/kinoml.git  # clone the repo
cd kinoml  # change directory to local copy of repo
mamba env create -n kinoml -f devtools/conda-envs/test_env.yaml
conda activate kinoml  
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/openkinome/kinoml.git 
```

Alternatively, you can use a docker image to start a Jupyter lab
instance with kinoml installed.

``` bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    openkinome/kinoml:latest
```

### Usage

The tutorials folder is divided into two parts:

1.  [**Getting
    started**](https://github.com/raquellrios/kinoml/tree/master/tutorials/getting_started):
    the notebooks in this folder aim to give the user an understanding
    of how to use KinoML to: (1) **access and download** data, (2)
    **featurize** data, and (3) **run a** (simple) **ML model** on the
    featurized data obtained with KinoML to predict ligand binding
    affinity. Additionally, this folder contains notebooks that explain
    the **KinoML object model** and how to access the different objects,
    as well as notebooks **showcasing all the different featurizers**
    implemented within KinoML and how to use each of them.

2.  [**Experiments**](https://github.com/raquellrios/kinoml/tree/master/tutorials/experiments):
    this folder contains four individual structure-based experiments to
    predict ligand binding affinity. All experiments use KinoML to
    obtain the data, featurize it and train and evaluate a ML model
    implemented within the`kinoml.ml` class. The purpose of these
    experiments is to display usage examples of KinoML to conduct
    end-to-end structure-based kinases experiments.

⚠️ You will need a valid OpenEye License for the tutorials to work. For
the Schrodinger featurizers tutorial you will also need a Schrodinger
License!

For users interested in more KinoML usage examples, they can checkout
other repositories under the initative
[OpenKinome](https://github.com/openkinome/). Particularly, other two
repositories that may be of interest are:

- [kinodata](https://github.com/openkinome/kinodata): repository with
  ready-to-use kinase-focused datasets from ChEMBL, as well as tutorials
  explaining how to process kinase data for ML applications.
- [experiments-binding-affinity](https://github.com/openkinome/experiments-binding-affinity):
  more advanced and reproducible ML experiments using KinoML.
